# Algs

A collection of algortithms, their tests and benchmarks. Mostly for studying of algorithms than for using in real projects.

Uses [`googletest`](https://github.com/google/googletest) for testing as a submodule.

# Installation

```
> git clone --recursive https://github.com/artemeknyazev/algs
```

# Testing

```
> cd algs && make
```
This command builds all possible tests. Look at the `TESTS` property in the `tests/Makefile` for all available ones. Output executables are plaed into `tests/build` under the same names.

# Benchmarking

Soon...
